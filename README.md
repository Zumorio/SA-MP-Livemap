FOR THE WEBFILES:
You require to have SanMap with the map rendered, link can be found below.
After you have rendered the whole map (Map & Satelite) you want to replace the current index with the one in the webfiles directory.
After doing that, change the index.php files to your database info which can be found at the top.

SQL:
Just import it into the wanted database and you're good to go.

FILTERSCRIPT:
Put it in your filterscripts folder, compile it with your database info, load the filterscript in your server and you're good to go.

This livemap is compatible with SanMap which can be found here:
